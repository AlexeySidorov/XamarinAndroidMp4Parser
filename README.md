Xamarin Android Mp4Parser IsoParser - Bindings and examples

Here's a working C# Xamarin Android binding of Sebastian Annies' IsoParser / Mp4Parser.

There's a demo showing how simple it is to merge any number of videos together.

The muxing functionalities are working too, I should eventually add an h264 and an aac track for a demo.
